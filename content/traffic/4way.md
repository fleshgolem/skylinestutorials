Title: Building the 4-way Cloverleaf

As the cloverleaf is perfectly symmetrical it actually should be easier to build since you really only have to think about 2 connections.

Let's look at the highways again. First of all you obviously need 2 sets of highways that cross each other

A car that is on A can either stay on A, change to B or change to C. Same for all other lanes. So we need:

1. A connection from A to B
2. A connection from A to C

And then repeat the whole thing four times

The first one is dead simple again:

And the second one isn't really that much harder

<a href="/images/4way3.jpg" data-lightbox="dont" data-title="">![](/images/thumbnails/400x_/4way3.jpg)</a>

Repeat the whole thing for all lanes and you are done

<a href="/images/4way4.jpg" data-lightbox="dont" data-title="">![](/images/thumbnails/400x_/4way4.jpg)</a>

Isn't she pretty? So yeah, that's really all there is to it. As in our simple 3-way in the last chapter, we have some entrances before exits, which isn't great, but practically doesn't really hurt. Once you have few enough traffic problems that this becomes your bottleneck, you should be able to design a better one yourself.
