Title: Building Highways Interchanges without having to think too much

A very simple Interchange
==========================

So here is a common occurence: You have a road crossing your highway:

<a href="/images/simple1.png" data-lightbox="dont" data-title="">![](/images/thumbnails/400x_/simple1.png)</a>

We can quickly turn this into an interchange by adding an on- and offramp on one side

<a href="/images/simple2.jpg" data-lightbox="dont" data-title="">![](/images/thumbnails/400x_/simple2.jpg)</a>

...and then repeat the same thing on the other one

<a href="/images/simple4.jpg" data-lightbox="dont" data-title="">![](/images/thumbnails/400x_/simple4.jpg)</a>

There you go, you have a working interchange.

Now while this works reasonably well in low traffic, a common problem is, that a car might have to go this way:

<a href="/images/simple5.jpg" data-lightbox="dont" data-title="">![](/images/thumbnails/400x_/simple5.jpg)</a>

Doing this it has to cross two intersection, blocking all the other exits and entrances. This can quickly lead to a lot of congestion.

Let's look into an actual 3-way then:

The 3-Way Prefab
================

Luckily enough the game already has a prefab for a 3-way interchange. The only problem with it is that you can't do this (in 99% of all cases that is):

<a href="/images/simple3way1.jpg" data-lightbox="dont" data-title="">![](/images/thumbnails/400x_/simple3way1.jpg)</a>

So first we have to bulldoze a lot of road to be able to build it (you should pause your game when doing stuff like this or you will likely cause traffic and also electricity problems)

<a href="/images/simple3way2.jpg" data-lightbox="dont" data-title="">![](/images/thumbnails/400x_/simple3way2.jpg)</a>

Next we can build it and reconnect everything

<a href="/images/simple3way3.jpg" data-lightbox="dont" data-title="">![](/images/thumbnails/400x_/simple3way3.jpg)</a>
<a href="/images/simple3way4.jpg" data-lightbox="dont" data-title="">![](/images/thumbnails/400x_/simple3way4.jpg)</a>
<a href="/images/simple3way5.jpg" data-lightbox="dont" data-title="">![](/images/thumbnails/400x_/simple3way5.jpg)</a>

And that is already all there is to it. This simple interchange should be enough for pretty much all you 3-way intersections, if you do get traffic problems you can propably identify a root cause somewhere else

The 4-Way Prefab
================

Now for cases where we actually need to cross our highway:

<a href="/images/simple4way1.jpg" data-lightbox="dont" data-title="">![](/images/thumbnails/400x_/simple4way1.jpg)</a>

We can use the 4-way cloverleaf prefab in the same vein:

<a href="/images/simple4way2.jpg" data-lightbox="dont" data-title="">![](/images/thumbnails/400x_/simple4way2.jpg)</a>
<a href="/images/simple4way3.jpg" data-lightbox="dont" data-title="">![](/images/thumbnails/400x_/simple4way3.jpg)</a>

Again, this is already very efficient and should be enough for most of you needs
